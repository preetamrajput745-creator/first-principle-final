   - PASSED: 2FA Mock Check
   - PASSED: Alert Routing to Owner Pager
   - PASSED: Audit Signing & Integrity

4. EVIDENCE:
   - Audit logs generated in audit_storage/
   - Verification logs captured above.

Zero-Tolerance Spec Met:
- Owner is the only role capable of 'approve_policy' and 'signoff_promotion'.
- All Owner actions are immutably logged and signed.
- Critical alerts route specifically to Owner.
